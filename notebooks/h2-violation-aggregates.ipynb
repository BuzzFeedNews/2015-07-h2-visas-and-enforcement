    "# Aggregated H-2 Guest Worker Violations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code below loads all WHISARD violations since 2005 (based on the end-date of the violation period); isolates the violations of laws meant to protect H-2 workers; and provides aggregate counts of the number of employers, certain violations, and workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load all violations, and limit them to those that meet all of the following critera: (a) `DATE_END_VIOL_YEAR` is 2005 or later; (b) Classified as having an `ACT_ID` of \"H2A\" or \"H2B\"; and (c) has an `E` (employee) record flag, as opposed to an `R` (employer) record flag.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Group all of these violations by their violation \"description.\" Count the number of matching violations for each description.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify violations that pertain to U.S. workers, rather than guest workers, and exclude them from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Identify violations that pertain to *underpaying* guest workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculate the number of workers affected by each set of violations, and the number of employers named (based on the first available of the following: federal EIN, legal name, trade name)."
